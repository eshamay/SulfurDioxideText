\subsection{Surface Density Distributions}

One measure of surface activity is the spatial distribution of molecules in the interfacial region. The density distributions of both \wat~and \suldiox~were calculated for the equilibrium MD simulations, and the results are presented in figure \ref{fig:density} for both the neat-water and saturated simulations. The \suldiox~in the neat-water system remained at the top slab surface. The \suldiox~in the saturated system accumulated mostly at the surface, but some residual \suldiox~remained in the bulk.

%The density distributions of the \suldiox~were fit to gaussian lineshapes as shown in equation \ref{eq:gaussian} using the common definitions of the variables $A$, $\mu$, and $\sigma$, and given as a function of the distance to the top surface, $z$.

%\begin{equation}
%  \rho(z)=\frac{A}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
%  \label{eq:gaussian}
%\end{equation}

In the simulated neat-water slab, the \suldiox~molecular density distribution indicates an affinity for the water surface. During the course of the simulation, the \suldiox~does not venture into the water bulk. Also, the \suldiox~does not escape the water surface into the gas phase, but remains located within 5-\angs~of the surface. This is consistent with what is found experimentally in our laboratory using VSFS,\cite{Tarbuck2005,Tarbuck2006} and also verified by the computational simulations and spectral calculations of Baer et al.\cite{Baer2010} The experimental studies indicated that upon exposure of \suldiox~to a \wat~surface, a layer of \suldiox~hydrate complex forms, modifying the structure of water above the Gibbs dividing surface (GDS). The \suldiox~bonding interaction with the free OH oscillators is manifested in a red-shift of the free OH frequency indicative of a bonding interaction. In a later section of this article we look at the effect of \suldiox~on surface water orientation.

The saturated surface simulation results indicate that under the high concentration conditions, \suldiox~accumulation at the surface is increased. However, unlike the neat-water slab, the saturated slab has a non-zero bulk concentration of \suldiox. The added concentration of \suldiox~creates a layer of molecules bound to the top of the water surface. The center of the \suldiox~density distribution is further into the gas phase than for the neat-water surface with a single-\suldiox~molecule. Because of the limitations of the classical model in accurately reproducing the first hydration shell around the \suldiox,\cite{Baer2010} we do not draw specific conclusions about the hydrate complex's geometry. However, the surface affinity of the hydrated \suldiox~is well reproduced by both the classical and ab initio methods, and is furthermore verified by our experimental results.

The position axis shows the distance of the given molecule from the top surface of the \wat~slab, with positive values located above the slab towards the gas phase, and negative values located in the water bulk. Distributions of both the neat-water simulation with a single \suldiox~(left, scaled 10x for clarity), and the saturated system (right) are shown.}
