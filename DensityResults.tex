\subsection{Surface Density Distributions}

One measure of surface activity is the spatial distribution of molecules in the interfacial region. The density distributions of both \wat~and \suldiox~were calculated for the equilibrium MD simulations. The results presented in Figure \ref{fig:density} show both the water (black) and \suldiox~(red) density distributions across the two simulated slabs. As shown, the single \suldiox~in the neat-water system remained at the water slab surface. The \suldiox~in the saturated system accumulated mostly at the surface, but some residual \suldiox~remained well into the bulk water.

%The density distributions of the \suldiox~were fit to gaussian lineshapes as shown in equation \ref{eq:gaussian} using the common definitions of the variables $A$, $\mu$, and $\sigma$, and given as a function of the distance to the top surface, $z$.

%\begin{equation}
%  \rho(z)=\frac{A}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
%  \label{eq:gaussian}
%\end{equation}

In the simulated neat-water slab, the \suldiox~molecular density distribution concentrates near the water surface location, indicating an affinity for the interfacial region. During the course of the simulation, the \suldiox~does not venture into the bulk water nor does it escape the water surface into the gas phase, but remains located within 5-\angs~of the surface region. This is consistent with what is found experimentally in our laboratory using VSFS,\cite{Tarbuck2005,Tarbuck2006} and also supported by the computational simulations and spectral calculations of Baer et al.\cite{Baer2010} The experimental studies indicated that upon exposure of \suldiox~to a \wat~surface, a layer of solvated \suldiox~forms, modifying the structure of water in the upper surface region. In the experimental system, the \suldiox~bonding interaction with the free OH oscillators is manifested in a red-shift of the free OH frequency indicative of a bonding interaction. 

The saturated solution simulation results indicate that under the high concentration of \suldiox, the \suldiox~accumulation at the surface is increased. However, unlike the neat-water slab, the saturated slab has a non-zero bulk concentration of \suldiox. The added concentration of \suldiox~creates a layer of molecules bound to the top of the water surface. The center of the \suldiox~density distribution is further into the gas phase than for the neat-water surface with a single-\suldiox~molecule. Because of the limitations of the classical model in accurately reproducing the first hydration shell around the \suldiox, we do not draw specific conclusions about the hydrated surface complex's geometry. However, the surface affinity of the hydrated \suldiox~is well reproduced by both the classical and ab initio methods.\cite{Baer2010}

The position axis shows the distance from the instantaneous surface location of the \wat~slab, with positive values located above the slab towards the gas phase, and negative values located in the water bulk. Distributions of both the neat-water simulation with a single \suldiox~(left, with the \suldiox~density scaled 10x for clarity), and the saturated system (right) are shown.}
