	oxygen is 3-coordinated. An analog of the Bernal-Fowler ice rules,
	when combined with graph-theoretic facts about polyhedra, leads to
	a rich variety of mathematical relationships regarding structural
	descriptors of PWCs. These relationships are developed and rigorously
	proved. The emphasis is on relationships involving four structural
	parameters which are correlated with the electronic energy of PWCs.
	Principal results are the recognition of the importance of three
	levels of information in the H-bonding pattern of a PWC; the definition
	and classification of the `F-components' and `L-coraponents' of a
	PWC; a method for generating all PWCs obeying the ice rules for a
	given polyhedral pattern; and a method based on the four-color theorem
	for producing low energy PWCs that have a property called `contiguity

	been investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to investigate
	the surface speciation and surface coverage of sulfur-containing
	products on ca. 4 nm TiO2 anatase particles that remain on the surface
	following adsorption of SO2. The effects of various environmental
	conditions of relative humidity, molecular oxygen, and broadband
	UV/vis irradiation as well as sample pretreatment were found to impact
	the speciation of adsorbed SO2 as well as the saturation coverage.
	In particular, in the absence of light, the majority surface species
	upon SO2 adsorption is found to be adsorbed sulfite. Broadband UV/vis
	irradiation during sulfur dioxide adsorption leads to an increase
	(nearly 2-fold) in the amount of adsorbed sulfur species, as compared
	to experiments with no light, and results in the formation of adsorbed
	sulfate. The formation of sulfate was quantitative in the presence
	of molecular oxygen. New surface species including chemisorbed molecular
	SO2 were observed on samples that have been reduced in vacuum through
	argon ion sputtering. The total amount of adsorbed sulfur was impacted
	by surface hydroxyl group coverage and molecularly adsorbed water
	layer. Additionally, comparison of sulfur dioxide adsorption on 4
	versus 32 nm sized anatase nanoparticles showed that surface saturation
	coverages of adsorbed sulfite on the 4 nm particles was almost twice
	that of 32 nm particles as measured by the S2p:Ti2p peak area ratios,
	thus showing an increase in the inherent adsorption capacity of the
	smaller particles. Proposed adsorption sites and mechanisms to account
	for the observed experimental data are discussed. },

	The ice surfaces are formed by freezing liquid water. Unlike the
	uptakes of strong acids such as HNo3 and HCl, the SO2 and H2O2 uptakes
	are fully reversible on the time scale of the experiment and the
	surface coverages are roughly a thousandth of a monolayer at 10(-6)
	Torr partial pressure and 228 K. The SO2 uptakes scale with the square
	root of the partial pressure of the SO2 gas, indicating that dissociation
	of the hydrated form of adsorbed SO2 is occurring on the surface.
	The H2O2 uptakes scale linearly with the H2O2 partial pressure, indicating
	that dissociation does not occur. The uptakes are driven by H-bond
	interactions in this case. Support for these conclusions comes from
	uptake measurements with ice surfaces which were formed by freezing
	either acidic or basic aqueous solutions. Although the H2O2 uptakes
	are independent of pH, the acidic ice surfaces considerably inhibit
	the SO2 uptake and the basic surfaces enhance the SO2 uptake. The
	results in this paper are consistent with atmospheric observations
	which show that both S(IV) and H2O2 have low retention efficiencies

	that the water trimer, tetramer, and pentamer have cyclic planar
	minimum energy structures. A prismlike structure is predicted to

	is the second lowest in energy, with an energy of about 0.2 kcal/mol

	microscopic level and has a thickness of 3.2 Angstrom at 298 K. These
	results are consistent with those reported in earlier work on the
	same systems. The calculated surface tension at room temperature
	is in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental data.
	As expected, the computed average dipole moments of water molecules
	near the interface are close to their gas phase values, while water
	molecules far from the interface have dipole moments corresponding

	and 3696 cm(-1). The phases of the 3 117 and 3696 cm(-1) resonances
	carried a positive sign, which indicates that these features arise
	from OH groups with protons facing upward toward the air. The other
	two resonances emanate from OH groups with protons facing downward
	toward the bulk aqueous solution, On the basis of this, we assign
	the 3117 cm(-1) peak to the OH moiety from a water molecule in the
	second layer, which is hydrogen bonded upward toward the top layer.
	On the other hand, the peak at 3222 cm(-1) should arise from water
	molecules in the top layer with the OH moiety facing downward to
	hydrogen bond to the second layer. The 3448 cm(-1) peak arises from
	hydrogen bonding between water molecules in the second layer and
	the more disordered water molecules of the bulk liquid. Finally,
	the peak at 3696 cm(-1) is assigned to the free OH moiety pointing
	upward in the top layer. },

	cost limited the estimation of the free energy typically over just
	a few pullings, thus impeding the evaluation of statistical uncertainties
	involved. In this work, we performed two thousand pulls for the permeation
	of a potassium ion in the gramicidin A pore by all-atom molecular
	dynamics in order to assess the bidirectional SMD protocol with a
	proper amount of sampling. The estimated free energy profile still
	shows a statistical error of several kcal/mol, while the work distributions
	are estimated to be non-Gaussian at pulling speeds of 10 angstrom/ns.
	We discuss the methodology and the confidence intervals in relation
	to increasing amounts of computed trajectories and how different

	numerous new exercises.<P> Although this book was conceived several
	decades ago, it is still a timeless classic. One of the book's greatest
	strengths is the wonderful collection of problems that accompany
	each chapter. The author has chosen problems carefully and indexed
	them according to difficulty. Solving a substantial number of these
	problems will help you gain a solid understanding of the issues surrounding
	the given topic. Furthermore, the exercises feature a variety of
	classic problems.<P> <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> begins with mathematical
	preliminaries. The first section offers a good grounding in a variety
	of useful mathematical tools: proof techniques, combinatorics, and
	elementary number theory. Knuth then details the MIX processor, a
	virtual machine architecture that serves as the programming target
	for subsequent discussions. This wonderful section comprehensively
	covers the principles of simple machine architecture, beginning with
	a register-level discussion of the instruction set. A later discussion
	of a simulator for this machine includes an excellent description
	of the principles underlying the implementation of subroutines and
	co-routines. Implementing such a simulator is an excellent introduction
	to computer design.<P> In the second section, Knuth covers data structures--stacks,
	queues, lists, arrays, and trees--and presents implementations (in
	MIX assembly) along with techniques for manipulating these structures.
	Knuth follows many of the algorithms with careful time and space
	analysis. In the section on tree structures, the discussion includes
	a series of interesting problems concerning the combinatorics of
	trees (counting distinct trees of a particular form, for example)
	and some particularly interesting applications. Also featured is
	a discussion of Huffmann encoding and, in the section on lists, an
	excellent introduction to garbage collection algorithms and the difficult
	challenges associated with such a task. The book closes with a discussion
	of dynamic allocation algorithms.<P> The clear writing in <I>Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> is enhanced by Knuth's dry humor and the historical
	discussions that accompany the technical matter. Overall, this text
	is one of the great classics of computer programming literature--it's

	also analyzed in the presence of halothane molecules. Although the
	accuracy of the current PMF calculation from SMD simulations is not
	yet sufficient to quantify the PMF difference with and without anesthetics,
	the comparison of the overall PMF profiles nevertheless confirms
	that the anesthetics cause insignificant changes to the structural
	makeup of the free energy wells along the channel and the overall
	permeation barrier. On average, the PMF appears less rugged in the
	outer part of the channel in the presence of anesthetics, consistent
	with our earlier finding that halothane interaction with anchoring
	residues makes the gA channel more dynamic. A causal relationship
	was observed between the reorientation of the coordinating backbone
	carbonyl oxygen and Na+ transit from one energy well to another,
	suggesting the possibility that even minute changes in the conformation
	of pore-lining residues due to dynamic motion could be sufficient
	to trigger the ion permeation. Because some of the carbonyl oxygens
	contribute to Na+ coordination in two adjacent energy wells, our
	SMD results reveal that the atomic picture of ion "hopping" through
	a gA channel actually involves a Na+ ion being carried in a relay
	by the coordinating oxygens from one energy well to the next. Steered
	molecular dynamics complements other computational approaches as
	an attractive means for the atomistic interpretation of experimental
	permeation studies. },

	In addition, SO2 is fundamentally interesting because it forms spectroscopically

	sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) is used here to further investigate
	the mechanism by which SO2 adsorbs to water at tropospherically relevant
	temperatures (0-23 degrees C). The spectral results lead to two important
	conclusions. SO2 surface affinity is enhanced at colder temperatures,
	with nearly all of the topmost water molecules showing evidence of
	binding to SO2 at 0 degrees C as compared to a much lower fraction
	at room temperature. This surface adsorption results in significant
	changes in water orientation at the surface, but is reversible at
	the temperatures examined here. Second, the SO2 complex formation
	at aqueous surfaces is independent of aqueous solution acidity. One
	challenge in previous uptake studies was the ability to distinguish
	between the effects of surface adsorption as compared to bulk accommodation.
	The surface and vibrational specificity of these studies make this

  abstract = {Surface tension, gamma, strongly affects interfacial properties in
	fluids. The degree to which polarizability affects gamma in water
	is thus far not well established. To address this situation, we carry
	out molecular dynamics simulations to study the interfacial forces
	acting on a slab of liquid water surrounded by vacuum using the Gaussian
	charge polarizable (GCP) model at 298.15 K. The GCP model incorporates
	both a fixed dipole due to Gaussian distributed charges and a polarizable
	dipole. We find a well-defined bulklike region forms with a width
	of approximate to 31 A. The average density of the bulklike region
	agrees with the experimental value of 0.997 g/cm(3). However, we
	find that the orientation of the molecules in the bulklike region
	is strongly influenced by the interfaces, even at a distance five
	molecular diameters from the interface. Specifically, the orientations
	of both the permanent and induced dipoles show a preferred orientation
	parallel to the interface. Near the interface, the preferred orientation
	of the dipoles becomes more pronounced and the average magnitude
	of the induced dipoles decreases monotonically. To quantify the degree
	to which molecular orientation affects gamma, we calculate the contributions
	to gamma from permanent dipolar interactions, induced dipolar interactions,
	and dispersion forces. We find that the induced dipole interactions
	and the permanent dipole interactions, as well as the cross interactions,
	have positive contributions to gamma, and therefore contribute stability
	to the interface. The repulsive core interactions result in a negative
	contribution to gamma, which nearly cancels the positive contributions
	from the dipoles. The large negative core contributions to gamma
	are the result of small oxygen-oxygen separation between molecules.
	These small separations occur due to the strong attractions between
	hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The final predicted value for gamma (68.65
	mN/m) shows a deviation of approximate to 4\% of the experimental
	value of 71.972 mN/m. The inclusion of polarization is critical for
	this model to produce an accurate value. (c) 2006 American Institute

	Objective: To systematically review the association between air pollutants
	and birth outcomes of low birth weight (LBW), preterm (PTB) and small
	for gestational age (SGA) births. Methods: Electronic databases and
	bibliographies of identified articles were searched for English language
	studies reporting on birth outcomes. Included studies were assessed
	for risks of bias in the selection, exposure assessment, confounder
	adjustment, analyses, outcomes assessment, and attrition. Unadjusted
	and adjusted estimates from included studies were extracted. Methodological
	differences between the studies were evaluated. Results: A total
	of 41 studies, mostly with a moderate risk of biases due to indirect
	assessment methods employed, met the eligibility criteria. Exposure
	to sulphur dioxide was associated with PTB, exposure to fine particulate
	matter (PM) of <= 2.5 mu M was associated with LBW. PTB and SGA births,
	and exposure to coarse PM of <= 10 mu m was associated with SGA births.
	The evidence for nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and carbon
	monoxide was inconclusive. Conclusions: Reported associations, and
	lack thereof, between individual air pollutants and birth outcomes
	have differed across published studies. This heterogeneity and/or
	absence of association may be due to difficulty in quantifying exposure,
	method of ascertainment, time of measurement and collinearity between
	pollutants. Important future research directions include developing
	improved methods to detect the duration and intensity of exposure,
	including entire populations, as well as performing well-designed

  year = {2011},
  volume = {48},
  pages = {470--481},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {Background. Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways,
	is associated with reversible airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness
	to triggers; clinical symptoms include wheezing, episodic cough,
	shortness of breath, and increased mucous production. Ambient or
	outdoor environmental exposure to ozone, particulate matter, sulfur
	dioxide, and nitrogen oxides has been well documented to exacerbate
	asthma. Children appear to be most vulnerable to the harmful effects
	of ambient air pollutants. As their lungs are not completely developed,
	children may experience greater exposure to environmental pollutants
	than adults and the higher doses of varied composition may remain
	in their lungs for a greater duration. Altogether, the negative effects
	of air pollutants on pulmonary function place children at a greater
	risk of air pollutant-induced exacerbation of asthma for the duration
	of their lives. Objectives. The aim of this review was to assess
	recently published literature regarding the influence of air pollution
	on asthma in children. Methods. For this work, we reviewed articles
	found in PubMed using the key words "outdoor air pollution, asthma,
	and children" which were published between 2006 and 2009. Only those
	articles that had a full version available in PubMed were analyzed.
	Results. We reviewed studies published between 2006 and 2009 examining
	the effect of outdoor air pollution on asthma in children. In total,
	we evaluated 25 articles; of these, 9 were published in 2006, 3 in
	2007, 8 in 2008, and 5 in 2009. Of these 25 studies, 1 was a clinical
	trial, 6 were cross-sectional, 4 were case-control (2 with a case-crossover
	design), 12 were cohort prospective, and 2 were cohort retrospective
	studies with varied follow-up times ranging from 10 days to 7 years.
	The ages of children also differed, ranging from birth to 18 years
	of age. Conclusions. All studies reviewed in this work indicate that
	outdoor air pollution affects the appearance and exacerbation of
	asthma in children. Although these findings are of great interest,
	the limitations of noted works make future investigations of the
	effect of air pollution on asthma in children essential. },
