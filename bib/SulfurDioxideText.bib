  abstract = {Polyhedral water clusters (PWCs) are (H2O)(n) Clusters in which every
	oxygen is 3-coordinated. An analog of the Bernal-Fowler ice rules,
	when combined with graph-theoretic facts about polyhedra, leads to
	a rich variety of mathematical relationships regarding structural
	descriptors of PWCs. These relationships are developed and rigorously
	proved. The emphasis is on relationships involving four structural
	parameters which are correlated with the electronic energy of PWCs.
	Principal results are the recognition of the importance of three
	levels of information in the H-bonding pattern of a PWC; the definition
	and classification of the `F-components' and `L-coraponents' of a
	PWC; a method for generating all PWCs obeying the ice rules for a
	given polyhedral pattern; and a method based on the four-color theorem
	for producing low energy PWCs that have a property called `contiguity
	two'. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on titanium dioxide (TiO2)
	nanoparticle surfaces at 296 K under a wide range of conditions has
	been investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to investigate
	the surface speciation and surface coverage of sulfur-containing
	products on ca. 4 nm TiO2 anatase particles that remain on the surface
	following adsorption of SO2. The effects of various environmental
	conditions of relative humidity, molecular oxygen, and broadband
	UV/vis irradiation as well as sample pretreatment were found to impact
	the speciation of adsorbed SO2 as well as the saturation coverage.
	In particular, in the absence of light, the majority surface species
	upon SO2 adsorption is found to be adsorbed sulfite. Broadband UV/vis
	irradiation during sulfur dioxide adsorption leads to an increase
	(nearly 2-fold) in the amount of adsorbed sulfur species, as compared
	to experiments with no light, and results in the formation of adsorbed
	sulfate. The formation of sulfate was quantitative in the presence
	of molecular oxygen. New surface species including chemisorbed molecular
	SO2 were observed on samples that have been reduced in vacuum through
	argon ion sputtering. The total amount of adsorbed sulfur was impacted
	by surface hydroxyl group coverage and molecularly adsorbed water
	layer. Additionally, comparison of sulfur dioxide adsorption on 4
	versus 32 nm sized anatase nanoparticles showed that surface saturation
	coverages of adsorbed sulfite on the 4 nm particles was almost twice
	that of 32 nm particles as measured by the S2p:Ti2p peak area ratios,
	thus showing an increase in the inherent adsorption capacity of the
	smaller particles. Proposed adsorption sites and mechanisms to account
	for the observed experimental data are discussed. },

	properties. The following two series of hydrocarbons are considered:
	(1) n-pentane, 2-methylpentane, and 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane (constant
	chain length) and (2) n-octane, 2-methyl heptane, and 2,2,4-trimethyl
	pentane (constant molecular mass). With a simple algorithm for identification
	of surface sites and mapping nonsurface sites to these surface sites,
	intrinsic profiles were constructed with respect to the surface layer.
	Intrinsic density profiles for water and hydrocarbons with respect
	to the hydrocarbon and water surface, respectively, resemble density
	profiles of liquids in the presence of a wall. Order parameters were
	used to study orientation of molecules with respect to the surface
	normal and the hydrogen bond network was characterized in terms of
	the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule and percentage of
	hydrogen bonded molecules in the first coordination shell. The corresponding
	intrinsic profiles were obtained. The O-H bond for surface water
	was found to have two preferential orientations, pointing toward
	the hydrocarbon phase and parallel to the interface. Hydrocarbon
	molecules in series 1 orient along the interface with the more branched
	molecule better aligned. For molecules in series 2, the larger molecular
	length reduces the alignment of molecules along the interface.},

  abstract = {The molecular dynamics computer simulation technique is used to develop
	a rigid, four-site polarizable model for water. The suggested model
	reasonably describes the important properties of water clusters,
	the thermodynamic and structural properties of the liquid and the
	liquid/vapor interface of water. The minimum energy configurations
	and the binding energies for these clusters are in reasonable agreement
	with accurate electronic structure calculations. The model predicts
	that the water trimer, tetramer, and pentamer have cyclic planar
	minimum energy structures. A prismlike structure is predicted to
	be lowest in energy for the water hexamer, and a cagelike structure
	is the second lowest in energy, with an energy of about 0.2 kcal/mol
	higher than the prismlike structure. The results are consistent with
	recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations as well as electronic structure
	calculations. The computed thermodynamic properties for the model,
	at room temperature, including the liquid density, the enthalpy of
	vaporization, as well as the diffusion coefficient, are in excellent
	agreement with experimental values. Structural properties of liquid
	water, such as the radial distribution functions, neutron, and x-ray
	scattering intensities, were calculated and critically evaluated
	against the experimental measurements. In all cases, we found the
	agreement between the observed data and the computed properties to
	be quite reasonable. The computed density profile of the water's
	liquid/vapor interface shows that the interface is not sharp at a
	microscopic level and has a thickness of 3.2 Angstrom at 298 K. These
	results are consistent with those reported in earlier work on the
	same systems. The calculated surface tension at room temperature
	is in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental data.
	As expected, the computed average dipole moments of water molecules
	near the interface are close to their gas phase values, while water
	molecules far from the interface have dipole moments corresponding
	to their bulk values. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics. },

	of a simulator for this machine includes an excellent description
	of the principles underlying the implementation of subroutines and
	co-routines. Implementing such a simulator is an excellent introduction
	to computer design.<P> In the second section, Knuth covers data structures--stacks,
	queues, lists, arrays, and trees--and presents implementations (in
	MIX assembly) along with techniques for manipulating these structures.
	Knuth follows many of the algorithms with careful time and space
	analysis. In the section on tree structures, the discussion includes
	a series of interesting problems concerning the combinatorics of
	trees (counting distinct trees of a particular form, for example)
	and some particularly interesting applications. Also featured is
	a discussion of Huffmann encoding and, in the section on lists, an
	excellent introduction to garbage collection algorithms and the difficult
	challenges associated with such a task. The book closes with a discussion
	of dynamic allocation algorithms.<P> The clear writing in <I>Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> is enhanced by Knuth's dry humor and the historical
	discussions that accompany the technical matter. Overall, this text
	is one of the great classics of computer programming literature--it's
	not an easy book to grasp, but one that any true programmer will
	study with pleasure.},

  abstract = {Sulfate particles play a key role in the air quality and the global
	climate, but the heterogeneous formation mechanism of sulfates on
	surfaces of atmospheric particles is not well established. Carbonates,
	which act as a reactive component in mineral dust due to their special
	chemical properties, may contribute significantly to the sulfate
	formation by heterogeneous processes. This paper presents a study
	on the oxidation of SO2 by O-3 on CaCO3 particles. Using Diffuse
	Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS), the
	formation of sulfite and sulfate on the surface was identified, and
	the roles of O-3 and water in oxidation processes were determined.
	The results showed that in the presence of O-3, SO2 can be oxidized
	to sulfate on the surface of CaCO3 particles. The reaction is first
	order in SO2 and zero order in O-3. The reactive uptake coefficient
	for SO2 [(0.6 - 9.8) x 10(14) molecule cm(-3)] oxidation by O-3 [(1.2
	- 12) x 10(14) molecule cm(-3)] was determined to be (1.4 +/- 0.3)
	x 10(-7) using the BET area as the reactive area and (7.7 +/- 1.6)
	x 10(-4) using the geometric area. A two-stage mechanism that involves
	adsorption of SO2 followed by O-3 oxidation is proposed and the adsorption
	of SO2 on the CaCO3 surface is the rate-determining step. The proposed
	mechanism can well explain the experiment results. The atmospheric
	implications were explored based on a box model calculation. It was
	found that the heterogeneous reaction might be an important pathway
	for sulfate formation in the atmosphere. },

  abstract = {Surface tension, gamma, strongly affects interfacial properties in
	fluids. The degree to which polarizability affects gamma in water
	is thus far not well established. To address this situation, we carry
	out molecular dynamics simulations to study the interfacial forces
	acting on a slab of liquid water surrounded by vacuum using the Gaussian
	charge polarizable (GCP) model at 298.15 K. The GCP model incorporates
	both a fixed dipole due to Gaussian distributed charges and a polarizable
	dipole. We find a well-defined bulklike region forms with a width
	of approximate to 31 A. The average density of the bulklike region
	agrees with the experimental value of 0.997 g/cm(3). However, we
	find that the orientation of the molecules in the bulklike region
	is strongly influenced by the interfaces, even at a distance five
	molecular diameters from the interface. Specifically, the orientations
	of both the permanent and induced dipoles show a preferred orientation
	parallel to the interface. Near the interface, the preferred orientation
	of the dipoles becomes more pronounced and the average magnitude
	of the induced dipoles decreases monotonically. To quantify the degree
	to which molecular orientation affects gamma, we calculate the contributions
	to gamma from permanent dipolar interactions, induced dipolar interactions,
	and dispersion forces. We find that the induced dipole interactions
	and the permanent dipole interactions, as well as the cross interactions,
	have positive contributions to gamma, and therefore contribute stability
	to the interface. The repulsive core interactions result in a negative
	contribution to gamma, which nearly cancels the positive contributions
	from the dipoles. The large negative core contributions to gamma
	are the result of small oxygen-oxygen separation between molecules.
	These small separations occur due to the strong attractions between
	hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The final predicted value for gamma (68.65
	mN/m) shows a deviation of approximate to 4\% of the experimental
	value of 71.972 mN/m. The inclusion of polarization is critical for
	this model to produce an accurate value. (c) 2006 American Institute

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to deconvolve the vibrational
	spectral features of the vapor-water interface based on molecular
	environment. A simple geometric description of hydrogen bonding is
	deployed to identify the OH stretch modes that comprise the vibrational
	sum-frequency spectrum of the vapor-water interface with direct comparison
	to our experimental results. The population densities of different
	species of water molecules are presented as functions of interfacial
	depth and orientation. It is found that surface water molecules that
	possess one proton donor bond and one proton acceptor bond make the
	dominant contribution to both the SSP- and SPS-polarized spectral
	responses and are located within an angstrom of the Gibbs dividing
	surface.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations utilizing many-body potentials of H2O-CCl4
	and H2O-vapor interfaces were carried out at different cesium and
	iodide ion concentrations to compare ion distribution, interfacial
	orientational and structural properties, and dynamics. It was found
	that cesium was repelled by both interfaces, and iodide was active
	at both interfaces, but to a much greater degree at the H2O-vapor
	interface. At the interface, the iodide dipole was strongly induced,
	orienting perpendicular to the interface for both systems, leading
	to stronger hydrogen bonds with water. For the H2O-CCl4 interface,
	though, there was a compensation between these strong hydrogen bonds
	and short to moderate ranged repulsion between iodide and CCl4. Hydrogen
	bond distance and angular distributions showed weaker water-water
	hydrogen bonds at both interfaces, but generally stronger water-iodide
	hydrogen bonds. Both translational and rotational dynamics of water
	were faster at the interface, while for CCl4, its translational dynamics
	was slower, but rotational dynamics faster at the interface. For
	many of the studied systems and species, translational diffusion
	was found to be anisotropic at both inter-facial and bulk regions.},

	dynamics simulation methods with the inclusion of polarizability
	for the understanding of aqueous interfaces. Comparisons among a
	variety of models, including those based on density functional theory
	of the neat air-water interface, are given. These results are used

	with recent spectroscopic studies. Also, the understanding of the
	contribution of polarization to the electrostatic potential across
	the air-water interface is elucidated. Finally, the importance of
