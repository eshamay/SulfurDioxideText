  abstract = {We investigated the solvation and spectroscopic properties of SO2
	at the air/water interface using molecular simulation. Molecular
	interactions from both Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT)
	and classical polarizable models were used to understand the properties
	of SO2:(H2O)(x) complexes in the vicinity of the air/water interface.
	The KS-DFT was included to allow comparisons with vibrational sum-frequency
	spectroscopy through the identification of surface SO2:(H2O)(x) complexes.
	Using our simulation results, we were able to develop a much more
	detailed picture of the surface structure of SO2 consistent with
	spectroscopic data obtained by Richmond and co-workers (J. Am. Chem.
	Soc. 2005, 127, 16806). We also found many similarities and differences
	between the two interaction potentials, including a noticeable weakness
	of the classical potential model in reproducing the asymmetric hydrogen
	bonding of water with SO2 due to its inability to account for SO2
	resonance structures.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation are performed for the water/hydrocarbon
	system to study the effect of hydrocarbon branching on interfacial
	properties. The following two series of hydrocarbons are considered:
	(1) n-pentane, 2-methylpentane, and 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane (constant
	chain length) and (2) n-octane, 2-methyl heptane, and 2,2,4-trimethyl
	pentane (constant molecular mass). With a simple algorithm for identification
	of surface sites and mapping nonsurface sites to these surface sites,
	intrinsic profiles were constructed with respect to the surface layer.
	Intrinsic density profiles for water and hydrocarbons with respect
	to the hydrocarbon and water surface, respectively, resemble density
	profiles of liquids in the presence of a wall. Order parameters were
	used to study orientation of molecules with respect to the surface
	normal and the hydrogen bond network was characterized in terms of
	the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule and percentage of
	hydrogen bonded molecules in the first coordination shell. The corresponding
	intrinsic profiles were obtained. The O-H bond for surface water
	was found to have two preferential orientations, pointing toward
	the hydrocarbon phase and parallel to the interface. Hydrocarbon
	molecules in series 1 orient along the interface with the more branched
	molecule better aligned. For molecules in series 2, the larger molecular
	length reduces the alignment of molecules along the interface.},

	of water is evaluated using classical molecular dynamics techniques

	calculations {[}Gregory, J. K.; Clary, D. C.; Liu, K.: Brown, M.
	G.; Saykally, R. J. Science 1997, 275, 814] is well-reproduced in

	conditions is investigated. The evolution of the hydrogen-bonding
	peak in g(OH) is in good agreement with recent data obtained by neutron
	diffraction with isotopic substitution experiments (NDIS) {[}Postorino,
	P.; Tromp, RH.; Ricci, M. A.; Soper, A. K.; Neilson, G. W. Nature
	1993, 366, 668]. This behavior can be attributed to the variability
	of water dipole moments in different environments, At conditions
	near critical temperature, in contrast with the interpretation of
	the NDIS data, the data from our simulations indicated that a considerable
	degree of hydrogen bonding remains at this state. This result is

  abstract = {Surface tension, gamma, strongly affects interfacial properties in
	fluids. The degree to which polarizability affects gamma in water
	is thus far not well established. To address this situation, we carry
	out molecular dynamics simulations to study the interfacial forces
	acting on a slab of liquid water surrounded by vacuum using the Gaussian
	charge polarizable (GCP) model at 298.15 K. The GCP model incorporates
	both a fixed dipole due to Gaussian distributed charges and a polarizable
	dipole. We find a well-defined bulklike region forms with a width
	of approximate to 31 A. The average density of the bulklike region
	agrees with the experimental value of 0.997 g/cm(3). However, we
	find that the orientation of the molecules in the bulklike region
	is strongly influenced by the interfaces, even at a distance five
	molecular diameters from the interface. Specifically, the orientations
	of both the permanent and induced dipoles show a preferred orientation
	parallel to the interface. Near the interface, the preferred orientation
	of the dipoles becomes more pronounced and the average magnitude
	of the induced dipoles decreases monotonically. To quantify the degree
	to which molecular orientation affects gamma, we calculate the contributions
	to gamma from permanent dipolar interactions, induced dipolar interactions,
	and dispersion forces. We find that the induced dipole interactions
	and the permanent dipole interactions, as well as the cross interactions,
	have positive contributions to gamma, and therefore contribute stability
	to the interface. The repulsive core interactions result in a negative
	contribution to gamma, which nearly cancels the positive contributions
	from the dipoles. The large negative core contributions to gamma
	are the result of small oxygen-oxygen separation between molecules.
	These small separations occur due to the strong attractions between
	hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The final predicted value for gamma (68.65
	mN/m) shows a deviation of approximate to 4\% of the experimental
	value of 71.972 mN/m. The inclusion of polarization is critical for
	this model to produce an accurate value. (c) 2006 American Institute
