  abstract = {Polyhedral water clusters (PWCs) are (H2O)(n) Clusters in which every
	oxygen is 3-coordinated. An analog of the Bernal-Fowler ice rules,
	when combined with graph-theoretic facts about polyhedra, leads to
	a rich variety of mathematical relationships regarding structural
	descriptors of PWCs. These relationships are developed and rigorously
	proved. The emphasis is on relationships involving four structural
	parameters which are correlated with the electronic energy of PWCs.
	Principal results are the recognition of the importance of three
	levels of information in the H-bonding pattern of a PWC; the definition
	and classification of the `F-components' and `L-coraponents' of a
	PWC; a method for generating all PWCs obeying the ice rules for a
	given polyhedral pattern; and a method based on the four-color theorem
	for producing low energy PWCs that have a property called `contiguity
	two'. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	properties. The following two series of hydrocarbons are considered:
	(1) n-pentane, 2-methylpentane, and 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane (constant
	chain length) and (2) n-octane, 2-methyl heptane, and 2,2,4-trimethyl
	pentane (constant molecular mass). With a simple algorithm for identification
	of surface sites and mapping nonsurface sites to these surface sites,
	intrinsic profiles were constructed with respect to the surface layer.
	Intrinsic density profiles for water and hydrocarbons with respect
	to the hydrocarbon and water surface, respectively, resemble density
	profiles of liquids in the presence of a wall. Order parameters were
	used to study orientation of molecules with respect to the surface
	normal and the hydrogen bond network was characterized in terms of
	the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule and percentage of
	hydrogen bonded molecules in the first coordination shell. The corresponding
	intrinsic profiles were obtained. The O-H bond for surface water
	was found to have two preferential orientations, pointing toward
	the hydrocarbon phase and parallel to the interface. Hydrocarbon
	molecules in series 1 orient along the interface with the more branched
	molecule better aligned. For molecules in series 2, the larger molecular
	length reduces the alignment of molecules along the interface.},

	a wide variety of algorithms and the analysis of them. Now in its
	third edition, <I>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume I: Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> contains substantial revisions by the author and includes
	numerous new exercises.<P> Although this book was conceived several
	decades ago, it is still a timeless classic. One of the book's greatest
	strengths is the wonderful collection of problems that accompany
	each chapter. The author has chosen problems carefully and indexed
	them according to difficulty. Solving a substantial number of these
	problems will help you gain a solid understanding of the issues surrounding
	the given topic. Furthermore, the exercises feature a variety of
	classic problems.<P> <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> begins with mathematical
	preliminaries. The first section offers a good grounding in a variety
	of useful mathematical tools: proof techniques, combinatorics, and
	elementary number theory. Knuth then details the MIX processor, a
	virtual machine architecture that serves as the programming target
	for subsequent discussions. This wonderful section comprehensively
	covers the principles of simple machine architecture, beginning with
	a register-level discussion of the instruction set. A later discussion
	of a simulator for this machine includes an excellent description
	of the principles underlying the implementation of subroutines and
	co-routines. Implementing such a simulator is an excellent introduction
	to computer design.<P> In the second section, Knuth covers data structures--stacks,
	queues, lists, arrays, and trees--and presents implementations (in
	MIX assembly) along with techniques for manipulating these structures.
	Knuth follows many of the algorithms with careful time and space
	analysis. In the section on tree structures, the discussion includes
	a series of interesting problems concerning the combinatorics of
	trees (counting distinct trees of a particular form, for example)
	and some particularly interesting applications. Also featured is
	a discussion of Huffmann encoding and, in the section on lists, an
	excellent introduction to garbage collection algorithms and the difficult
	challenges associated with such a task. The book closes with a discussion
	of dynamic allocation algorithms.<P> The clear writing in <I>Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> is enhanced by Knuth's dry humor and the historical
	discussions that accompany the technical matter. Overall, this text
	is one of the great classics of computer programming literature--it's
	not an easy book to grasp, but one that any true programmer will
	study with pleasure.},

  month = {SEP 7},
  abstract = {Surface tension, gamma, strongly affects interfacial properties in
	fluids. The degree to which polarizability affects gamma in water
	is thus far not well established. To address this situation, we carry
	out molecular dynamics simulations to study the interfacial forces
	acting on a slab of liquid water surrounded by vacuum using the Gaussian
	charge polarizable (GCP) model at 298.15 K. The GCP model incorporates
	both a fixed dipole due to Gaussian distributed charges and a polarizable
	dipole. We find a well-defined bulklike region forms with a width
	of approximate to 31 A. The average density of the bulklike region
	agrees with the experimental value of 0.997 g/cm(3). However, we
	find that the orientation of the molecules in the bulklike region
	is strongly influenced by the interfaces, even at a distance five
	molecular diameters from the interface. Specifically, the orientations
	of both the permanent and induced dipoles show a preferred orientation
	parallel to the interface. Near the interface, the preferred orientation
	of the dipoles becomes more pronounced and the average magnitude
	of the induced dipoles decreases monotonically. To quantify the degree
	to which molecular orientation affects gamma, we calculate the contributions
	to gamma from permanent dipolar interactions, induced dipolar interactions,
	and dispersion forces. We find that the induced dipole interactions
	and the permanent dipole interactions, as well as the cross interactions,
	have positive contributions to gamma, and therefore contribute stability
	to the interface. The repulsive core interactions result in a negative
	contribution to gamma, which nearly cancels the positive contributions
	from the dipoles. The large negative core contributions to gamma
	are the result of small oxygen-oxygen separation between molecules.
	These small separations occur due to the strong attractions between
	hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The final predicted value for gamma (68.65
	mN/m) shows a deviation of approximate to 4\% of the experimental
	value of 71.972 mN/m. The inclusion of polarization is critical for
	this model to produce an accurate value. (c) 2006 American Institute

  abstract = {The interface formed between an aqueous salt solution and a hydrophobic
	liquid has been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations.
	The salt solutions of NaCl, NaNO3, and Na2SO4 have been studied to
	determine their presence and distribution in the interfacial region
	and their effect on interfacial water molecules. Density and orientation
	profiles reveal the formation of ionic double layers with widths
	that vary with the respective anions' surface affinities and effects
	on the geometry of interfacial water molecules. The NO3- anion shows
	enhanced surface concentration above that of the bulk aqueous phase,
	whereas the Cl- and SO42- anions exhibit similar characteristics
	as are found for corresponding air-water interfaces. Sum frequency
	spectra were calculated for the OH vibrational modes of water to
	show the effect of the various ions on the hydrogen-bonding network
	strength of interfacial water. These calculated spectra show good
	agreement with the conclusions and observations of our recent spectroscopic
	experimental study, while providing important new detailed insights
	into interfacial behavior to augment that study.},

	Using the Polya theorem the cycle index expressions for 12 vertexes
	and 20 edges of a cuboid in point-group symmetry D-4h are developed.
	A total of 91 energy-allowed fused cubic structures are obtained,

	and H2O-vapor interfaces were carried out at different cesium and
	iodide ion concentrations to compare ion distribution, interfacial
	orientational and structural properties, and dynamics. It was found
	that cesium was repelled by both interfaces, and iodide was active
	at both interfaces, but to a much greater degree at the H2O-vapor
	interface. At the interface, the iodide dipole was strongly induced,
	orienting perpendicular to the interface for both systems, leading
	to stronger hydrogen bonds with water. For the H2O-CCl4 interface,
	though, there was a compensation between these strong hydrogen bonds
	and short to moderate ranged repulsion between iodide and CCl4. Hydrogen
	bond distance and angular distributions showed weaker water-water
	hydrogen bonds at both interfaces, but generally stronger water-iodide
	hydrogen bonds. Both translational and rotational dynamics of water
	were faster at the interface, while for CCl4, its translational dynamics
	was slower, but rotational dynamics faster at the interface. For
	many of the studied systems and species, translational diffusion
	was found to be anisotropic at both inter-facial and bulk regions.},
